Our company was founded in 1997 as Pegenau Software GmbH by Friedemann Pegenau. From the very beginning, we focused on developing customized software solutions for medium-sized businesses.

In 2013, we changed our name to Pegenau GmbH & Co. KG. Stefan Pegenau has also been Managing Director since then.

Since the beginning of 2017, the focus of our company has completely shifted. Today, we exclusively produce our own software products and standardized hardware solutions for small and medium-sized businesses. Since then, the team has also grown significantly, and since 2021, Stefan Pegenau has been the sole Managing Director.
